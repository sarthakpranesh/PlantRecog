# PlantRecog

PlantRecog aim to become or lead to the goto "Free Plant Recognition" solution. Why? As of today, 30th August 2021, their aren't many online free services or apps available to solve this problem. The existing solutions are mostly paid and have high subscription amounts per year. I want to create a fairly basic but usable set of services (app + api + models) for people who want to develop tools that recognize plants.

The current version of the project is able to recognize 104 plants using their flowers. This flower recognition model is hosted as an API available for public use and is also used in the PlantRecog App that can be downloaded from `Github Releases` (soon will be available on Google Play Store).

This is work in progress :>

<br />

## App
The PlantRecog expo app is still under development phase, therefore please check out the `pre-release` available in the `Github release` section [here](https://github.com/sarthakpranesh/PlantRecog/releases).

<br />

## Recognition Service
The hosted server routes are not yet documented, will be documented soon.
